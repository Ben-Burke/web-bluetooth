# web-bluetooth

The now decade old Web Bluetooth library in Chrome does have many examples online.

However, very few of them communicate with personal fitness or medical devices. 

This repo is for me to share some of the experience I've had with the library. Where possible, I'll create examples using noble and other BLE libraries

## Samples of Web Bluetooth applications

The first samples will be designed to work with Beurer medical devices:

1. The Beurer PO60 SPo2
2. The Beurer FT95

Beurer provides some documentation to developers if you register at their site. However, there are no examples.
